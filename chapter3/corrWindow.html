		<h1>Correlation Integral with Window Functions</h1>

		<p>
		In the years since I wrote the book, I have had many occasions to use the function corr2_ft.  Unfortunately, there is a better way to handle the mask of the output from this function.  Here, I elaborate on the details of correlation with masked data, provide an improved function to compute 2-D correlation, and show a couple of example.
		</p>

		<h2>Continuous 2-D Correlation of Window Functions</h2>
		<p>
		The continuous cross-correlation of two 2-D signals is given by<br/>
		\[
			C(\mathbf{r})=\int U_1 (\mathbf{s}) U_2 (\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{s}) \, \textrm{d}\mathbf{s}
		\]
		The limits of integration extend to +/- infinity.
		</p>
		<p>
		Regarding masks, there are a few interesting properties of this integral.  In this context, the term "mask" refers to a function whose value is 1 inside a given region of 2-D space and 0 elsewhere.  One important property is the auto-correlation's value at \(r = 0\).  Let's use \(W(r) = W(x,y)\) to denote a mask function and evaluate its auto-correlation's value at \(r = 0\), given by
		\[
			C(\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{0})=\int W (\mathbf{s}) W (\mathbf{s}) \, \textrm{d}\mathbf{s} = \int W (\mathbf{s}) \, \textrm{d}\mathbf{s} = A
		\]
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Note that \(W(s) W(s) = W(s)\) because \(W(s) = 1\) within the mask region, and \(A\) is the area of the mask.  This property was used in Section 3.2 of my book to remove the effect of the mask and isolate the cross-correlation of the two signals.

		At this point, I consider a couple of well-known examples.  After the examples, I cover properties of discrete cross-correlation and then provide Matlab examples.  The first example is a square mask given by
		\[
			W(x,y)= \textrm{rect}\left(\frac{x}{D}\right) \textrm{rect}\left(\frac{y}{D}\right).
		\]
		Note that in my book, \(D\) is the full width of the rect function, and its area is \(D^2\).  This mask's auto-correlation is given by
		\[
			C(x,y) = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} W(x^{\prime},y^{\prime}) W(x-x^{\prime},y-y^{\prime})  \, \textrm{d}x^{\prime} \textrm{d}y^{\prime}
 		\]
		\[
			C(x,y) = D^2 \textrm{tri} \left(\frac{x}{D}\right) \textrm{tri} \left(\frac{y}{D}\right)
		\]
		Its peak occurs at x=0, y=0.  This peak value is D^2, which is equal to the area of the mask.  Also, note the mask has nonzero values for  -D/2 < x < D/2 and -D/2 < y < D/2, while the mask's auto-correlation has nonzero values for -D < x < D and -D < y < D.  These two properties of the peak value and nonzero region are fairly general for the auto-correlation of mask functions.
		</p>
		<p>
		As a second example, I consider a circular mask function, given by
		\[
			W(\mathbf{r}) = \textrm{circ}\left(\frac{r}{D}\right)
		\]
		Its auto-correlation is given by
		\[
			C(\mathbf{r})= \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{2}{\pi} \left[\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{r}{D}\right) - \left(\frac{r}{D}\right) \sqrt{1-\left(\frac{r}{D}\right)^2}\right]
		\]
		Its peak value occurs at r = 0 and is equal to pi*D^2/4, which is the area of the circular mask.  The mask has nonzero values for 0 < r < D/2, and its auto-correlation has nonzero values for 0 < r < D.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Discrete Correlation of 2-D Window Functions</h2>
		<p>
		In my book, I try to use continuous functions as much as possible.  At some point, though, it is necessary to analyze the discrete calculations that actually occur in computers.  With that in mind, discrete cross-correlation is given by
		\[
			C_{m,n} = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{N-m-1} \sum\limits_{j=0}^{N-n-1} \, U_{i,j} \, U_{i-m,j-n}^{\ast} \text{    for    } m\geq0
		\]
		</p>
		<p>
		(Matlab help for xcorr is useful)

		Inside corr2_ft, the variable maskcorr is the autocorrelation of the signal's mask (the variable mask). In principle, the peak value of maskcorr should be equal to delta^2
